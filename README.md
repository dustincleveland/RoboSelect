# RoboSelect
RoboSelect is a product that allows users to fully customize and order cool robots! Unfortunately, because this is a portfolio project, you won't actually receive any of the robots you design (or get billed for them), but at least you can have fun exploring the product and maybe even learn something from it.

## Robots
There are many types of robots. Each robot is suited to one or more specific types of tasks, such as manufacturing, exploration, assisted living, and demolition. RoboSelect gives users a way to search for robots, select the best robot for a given task, and then customize that robot for the task.

## Projects
A project is a way for a user to organize the robots that she designs and purchases. Think of it like a shopping cart. Users often have many projects going at once, all of which can be accessed through the Projects panel.
